MCME MineCraft Mod Enabler
==========================

A simple program i made for my son
so he didnt have to keep moving forge mods
in and out of the mods folder

it works simply by renaming the mods extention from .zip to .not
so then minecraft doesnt load it

How to use the program
==========================

all mods that will load have a check next to them 
just uncheck the desired mod to stop it getting loaded
or check the desired mod to have it load

ToDo
==========================

add mod loader support
maybe more if i can think of something
